SUMMARY & USAGE LICENSE
=============================================

MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project
at the University of Minnesota.
 
This data set consists of:
	* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	* 1682电影,943用户,100万(1-5)评级
	* Each user has rated at least 20 movies.每个用户最少20个电影的评级
        * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
	* 一个简单的用户信息包括(年龄,性别,职业,邮编)

The data was collected through the MovieLens web site
(movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 
1997 through April 22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users
who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic
information were removed from this data set. Detailed descriptions of
the data file can be found at the end of this file.

Neither the University of Minnesota nor any of the researchers
involved can guarantee the correctness of the data, its suitability
for any particular purpose, or the validity of results based on the
use of the data set.  The data set may be used for any research
purposes under the following conditions:

     * The user may not state or imply any endorsement from the
       University of Minnesota or the GroupLens Research Group.

     * The user must acknowledge the use of the data set in
       publications resulting from the use of the data set
       (see below for citation information).

     * The user may not redistribute the data without separate
       permission.

     * The user may not use this information for any commercial or
       revenue-bearing purposes without first obtaining permission
       from a faculty member of the GroupLens Research Project at the
       University of Minnesota.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUPLENS RESEARCH PROJECT
==============================================

The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department
of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota.
Members of the GroupLens Research Project are involved in many
research projects related to the fields of information filtering,
collaborative filtering, and recommender systems. The project is lead
by professors John Riedl and Joseph Konstan. The project began to
explore automated collaborative filtering in 1992, but is most well
known for its world wide trial of an automated collaborative filtering
system for Usenet news in 1996.  The technology developed in the
Usenet trial formed the base for the formation of Net Perceptions,
Inc., which was founded by members of GroupLens Research. Since then
the project has expanded its scope to research overall information
filtering solutions, integrating in content-based methods as well as
improving current collaborative filtering technology.

Further information on the GroupLens Research project, including
research publications, can be found at the following web site:

GroupLens Research currently operates a movie recommender based on
collaborative filtering:

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF DATA FILES
==============================================

Here are brief descriptions of the data.
这里是简短的数据描述:

ml-data.tar.gz   -- Compressed tar file.  To rebuild the u data files do this:
		 --压缩的tar文件,重建U数据文件这样做
                gunzip ml-data.tar.gz
                tar xvf ml-data.tar
                mku.sh

u.data     -- 用户对电影的评级
			  The full u data set, 100000 ratings by 943 users on 1682 items.
			  100000评级由943用户1682个项目
              Each user has rated at least 20 movies.  Users and items are
	      每个用户都评级至少20个电影,用户和项目编号从1开始
              numbered consecutively from 1.  The data is randomly
	      数据是随机排序,这是一个标签分隔的列表
              ordered. This is a tab separated list of
             用户ID  | 影片ID  | 星级   | 时间戳			  
	      user id | item id | rating | timestamp. 
	      时间戳是UNIX从秒开始

	      一个电影可以多个流派
              is of that genre, a 0 indicates it is not; movies can be in
              several genres at once.
	      这部电影的入侵检测系统的数据的数据集
              The movie ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

u.genre    -- A list of the genres.一个电影分类的列表

u.user     -- 用户属性文件
              Demographic information about the users; this is a tab
              separated list of
	      用户ID  |年龄 | 性别   | 职业       | 邮编
              user id | age | gender | occupation | zip code
              The user ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

u.occupation -- A list of the occupations.一个职业列表

u1.base    -- The data sets u1.base and u1.test through u5.base and u5.test
u1.test       are 80%/20% splits of the u data into training and test data.
u2.base       Each of u1, ..., u5 have disjoint test sets; this if for
u2.test       5 fold cross validation (where you repeat your experiment
u3.base       with each training and test set and average the results).
u3.test       These data sets can be generated from u.data by mku.sh.
u4.base
u4.test
u5.base
u5.test

ua.base    -- The data sets ua.base, ua.test, ub.base, and ub.test
ua.test       split the u data into a training set and a test set with
ub.base       exactly 10 ratings per user in the test set.  The sets
ub.test       ua.test and ub.test are disjoint.  These data sets can
              be generated from u.data by mku.sh.

allbut.pl  -- The script that generates training and test sets where
              all but n of a users ratings are in the training data.

mku.sh     -- A shell script to generate all the u data sets from u.data.
